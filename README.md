==============
Custom alexnet models for training and testing on ImageNet.

The directories (or links) ILSVRC2012_img_train and ILSVRC2012_img_val should be added to the data directory containing the ImageNet training and validation sets respectively.

models.py contains custom Alexnet-like models.

To train, run trainer.py. The default model is plain Alexnet via the AlexNet class.
